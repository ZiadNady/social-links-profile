# Social Links Profile Project

## Overview

This project is a front-end component that displays a social profile card. The card includes the user's avatar, name, location, job title, and several buttons linking to their social media profiles. The design is minimalist, responsive, and uses custom CSS along with the Google Fonts API.

## Files Included

- **index.html**: The main HTML file containing the structure of the social links profile.
- **style.css**: The CSS file containing all the styles for the social links profile.
- **images/**: A folder containing images used in the project, such as `avatar-jessica.jpeg` and `favicon-32x32.png`.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: The standard markup language used to structure the content of the profile card.
- **CSS3**: The styling language used to design the appearance of the profile card.
- **Google Fonts**: The project uses the "Inter" font from Google Fonts.
- **Responsive Design**: The project is designed to be fully responsive, ensuring it looks good on various screen sizes.

## Structure

- **Container**: The `container` class centers the profile card on the page, giving it a dark background with rounded corners and padding for a sleek appearance.
- **Avatar**: The user's avatar is displayed at the top of the card, styled as a circular image.
- **Name, Location, and Job Title**: These elements are styled with specific fonts, colors, and spacing to create a clear visual hierarchy.
- **Buttons**: The buttons are styled consistently with the overall dark theme, with each button linking to a different social media platform.

## How to Use

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open `index.html` in your web browser to view the social links profile.
3. Customize the `style.css` file to adjust the design according to your preferences.

## Customization

- **Fonts**: You can change the font by modifying the `@import` line in the CSS file.
- **Colors**: Colors are defined using CSS variables at the beginning of the `style.css` file. You can easily modify them to match your design preferences.
- **Images**: Replace the avatar image in the `images` directory with your own image to personalize the profile.
